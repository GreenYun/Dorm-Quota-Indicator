# Dorm Quota Indicator
This project is an indicator to check dormitory elctricity usage and quota in Shenzhen University for macOS.

It is just a simple indicator showing in the status bar on the top of your screen. Just set your dormitory infomation and connect to the school network it will work fine that showing you the electricity usage in recent 7 days.

For some reason that I have not translated the strings other than English while keeping the building names as them in Chinese. It will be welcomed if anyone could help translating for those texts.

Any suggestions please submit issues for this project. Forking and redeveloping will be appreciated.

Finally, thanks to the project [TFHpple](https://github.com/topfunky/hpple) and contributors to that.
